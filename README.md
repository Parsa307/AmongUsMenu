## **Setup: How to Install Among Us Menu**

1. **Download BepInEx Bleeding Edge**
   Get it from: [BepInEx Bleeding Edge Builds](https://builds.bepinex.dev/projects/bepinex_be).

2. **Extract Files**  
   Unzip the BepInEx files into your Among Us installation directory.

3. **Add the Mod**  
   Copy `AmongUsMenu.dll` to the `BepInEx\plugins` folder.

4. **Optional but Recommended**  
   Install the [Open Sans font](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans) for a cleaner and more polished UI experience.

## **FAQ: Frequently Asked Questions**

**A:** MelonLoader unfortunately crashes when used with Among Us.

**Q: Why use the Bleeding Edge version of BepInEx instead of the Stable version?**
